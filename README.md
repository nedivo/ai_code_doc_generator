# **AI-Powered Code Documentation Generator**

## **Overview**

This tool is an AI-powered solution designed to analyze source code and automatically generate comprehensive documentation in MDX (Markdown + JSX) format. It leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to understand and document codebases, making the process of documentation faster, easier, and more efficient.

## **Features**

- **Automatic MDX File Generation**: Converts AI-generated documentation into MDX format, compatible with React components for interactive documentation elements.
- **Support for Various Programming Languages**: Integrates with multiple programming languages, analyzing code structure, patterns, and semantics.
- **Customizable Output**: Offers customization options for documentation output, such as template selection and styling.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management
